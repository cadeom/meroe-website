## Version History

### 1.2 — Screen 2 Stat Rewording
**Date:** 2026-07-05 20:47
**Description:**
- Changed stat label from "total project value" to "of project value"
- Changed stat sub from "is lost to rework that should have been caught in review." to "is typically lost to rework, much of it traceable to errors that better reviews could have caught."
- Big-number "5–15%" treatment kept as the visual anchor; source citation retained
- Corrected typo ("typpically") and grammar ("errors that better reviews could be caught") from the requested copy

**Files Changed:** `index.html`
**Archived:** `archived/260705-2047_pre-stat-copy-update.html`

### 1.1 — Lead Capture + Mobile Scroll Fixes
**Date:** 2026-07-05 18:52
**Description:**
- Changed Q3 copy: "who by" to "whom by"
- Wired contact form to Formspree (submissions go to info@cadeom.com)
- Fixed screen 3 (pillars) not scrolling on any device: a `position: relative` on `.s3` was overriding the `position: absolute` every slide needs to act as a scroll container
- Fixed screen 2 header being clipped by the nav bar on iPad/landscape: replaced `align-items: center` vertical centering (which pushes overflowing content above the reachable scroll area) with overflow-safe `margin: auto` centering on `.impact-inner` and `.pil-inner`

**Files Changed:** `index.html`
**Archived:** `archived/260705-1852_pre-scroll-fix.html`

## Notes

- Keep descriptions **brief but specific** — future-you will thank you
- Archive BEFORE deploying so you always have the previous working version
- Use 24-hour time (hhmm) in filenames for clarity
- Version numbers use point revisions: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, etc.
- Major feature additions = new major version (1.0 → 2.0)
- Bug fixes / tweaks = point revision (1.0 → 1.1)
