## Notes

- Keep descriptions **brief but specific** — future-you will thank you
- Archive BEFORE deploying so you always have the previous working version
- Use 24-hour time (hhmm) in filenames for clarity
- Version numbers use point revisions: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, etc.
- Major feature additions = new major version (1.0 → 2.0)
- Bug fixes / tweaks = point revision (1.0 → 1.1)
